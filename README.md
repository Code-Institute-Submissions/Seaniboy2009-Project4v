## Clarks restaurant  
## 1. Purpose of the project: 
- the purpose of the project is to create a fully functioning restaurant  website with the main 
    part being a booking system so that users can book a table, for admins/staff to also create bookings and update and edit them.
## 2. User stories:
- as a user i want to view the menu before booking
- as a user i want to book a table as a guest
- as a user i want to view by bookings account will be required
- as a user i want to see my confirmed booking
- as a admin i want to create and delete tables in the restaurant and update the site
- as a admin i want to be able to view all tables
- as a admin i want to be able to create new tables
- as a admin i want to be able to delete tables
- as a admin i want to be able to see all bookings and manage
- as a admin i want to be able to create menu items
- as a admin i want to be able to delete menu items
## 3. Features: 
- The booking system needs to have one table created for any bookings to be made, each booking request date and time is checked against the tables bookings, if no bookins then a booking can happen, if one table is booked for the time and date but another is not, a booking can happen, if all tables have a booking for the time and date then no bookings can happen, there is also a check for the date and time slot so users cant book the same time and date regardless of how many tables there are(avoid duplicate bookings)
- the django admin pannel should not be used to update/create any bookings as no checks can be done
- navigation bar
- no login

- fixed bugs
    - had a hard time trying to implement more than one table booking, the code was fine for any booking with one table, but as soon as there were two tables the functons where not working, i had to re-do the code a few times

- issues
    - bookings should not be deleted from the Django admin pannel as it will not update the booking amount for the table

- supported screens and browsers
    - tested using a galaxy s10 and s10 plus
    - tested on chrome on windows 10
    - tested on edge on windows 10

## 9. Deployment
   - Heroku
    - Deployment from heroku involved signing up to the site, click create your first app. to deploy my project i went to settings tab, click on add config vars and added the below:
        - API_KEY_KEY
        - API_SECRET_KEY
        - CLOUDINARY_URL
        - CLOUD_NAME_KEY
        - DATABASE_URL
        - DEBUG
        - DEVELOPMENT
        - PORT
        - SECRET_KEY
- once done i then clicked on the deploy tab linked to my github, selected the main branch then deployed, i set this to automatic deploys so when ever i made a change it would do it. New app > settings > config var > build packs > deploy
   
- via gitpod
   - Deployment from gitpod was done by adding changes to the python3 command line.
   - git add .
   - git commit -m "changes in here"
   - git push

   - to run the server from gitpod type python3 manage.py runserver
